# Math&maroc website

Landing page for Math&Maroc, made using Next.js, Chakra UI, and Contentful

### headless CMS

For now we're using **Contentful** which provides 2 locales max for free (see [link](https://www.contentful.com/pricing/))

We can use [**strapi**](https://strapi.io/starters/strapi-starter-next-js-blog) an open-source headless CMS, which we can host on Heroku for free, which would remove all limits

### Start the application

To run your site locally, use:

```
yarn dev
```

To run it in production mode, use:

```
yarn build
yarn start
```
